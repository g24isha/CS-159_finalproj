This repository contains the final project by Isha Goswami, Stavya Arora, Nora Xiao, and Sani Deshmukh for CS 159 at Caltech, built on top of the [original visprog codebase](https://github.com/allenai/visprog) from the paper [Visual Programming: Compositional visual reasoning without training by Tanmay Gupta and Aniruddha Kembhavi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11559).

Our modifications extend the original codebase to add new functionality for the 'Spot-the-Difference' agent we created by using GPT-4o to generate hypothesis-style questions and VisProg programs to identify differences between two images. The full report is in CS_159_Project_Report.pdf
